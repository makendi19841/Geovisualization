# Geovisualization_Labs
This course and lab exercises enabled me to understand the concepts of scene modelling in computer graphics, the 3D rendering pipeline, and have advanced knowledge about methods and algorithms for visualization and drawing in discrete space. I have become familiar with 3D object modelling (including solid modelling and curved surfaces), decompositions, interpolations, and texture mapping. Furthermore, I can use this know how to apply the learned methods for effective presentations of different types of geographical information. Parallel to the given theoretical knowledge, I have gained practical programming skills using common rendering libraries (e.g. OpenGL) and are capable to design and implement their own tools
